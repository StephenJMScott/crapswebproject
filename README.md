# Craps Web Project

This site was built over 4 days as a stand alone web development project for City and Guilds. It is being built using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. 
The goal is to build a mobile first responsive site without the use of any templates or frameworks such as Bootstap as in my previous projects.  

The game itself is going to be Craps, where all the logic will be done in the background using JavaScript.

## The Rules 

Up to four players will compete. The goal is to have the most in your pot by then end of a predetermined round, or to be the player with all the money! Whichever happens to occur first. 

Each player will begin the game with a pot of €100. The minimum bet will be €1 per observing player (€3 in a four man game), the maximum is what is in your pot.

Each round will begin with a round of betting. The active player, "The Shooter", makes a bet for their success. For simplicity this bet will be a multiple of the remaining players. The other players must then match this bet between them. 

For example, in a four player game, The Shooter bets €12 euro so each of the observing players must bet €4 each to remain in the game. If a player cannot match the minimum amount the most they can get back is twice their bet.

The game continues in this fashion until the round limit is exceeded or until one player holds all the money.
